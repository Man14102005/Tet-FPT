                        <p>
                            - These are two images that people are very interested in and compare with each other to see what characteristics of our ancestors' Tet holiday our Vietnamese people still retain and what differences have changed compared to the old Tet. Because time is something that can change everything, the ancient traditions of celebrating Tet have also been changed or transformed a lot by it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            - Especially when technology is increasingly affecting every activity in our lives. From shopping, entertainment, to daily eating,... from here, many customs and traditions have changed in modern Tet days. Tet costumes are no exception. Along with time, they have also been brought to life by designers of each era to create collections with unique impressions.
